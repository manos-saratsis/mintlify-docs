```typescript
// From RepositoryConnectionModal.tsx - repository fetching logic
const fetchRepositories = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('github_repositories')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', user.id)
    .order('name');
  
  if (error) {
    toast.error("Failed to fetch repositories");
    return;
  }
  
  setRepositories(data || []);
};
```

1. Review the list of available repositories
2. Select the repositories you want to enable for analysis
3. Click "Enable" for each repository you want to analyze
4. The system will automatically sync repository metadata and create database entries
