# How to Use Admin Workspaces

## Overview

Admin Workspaces is a powerful analytics dashboard that lets platform administrators monitor and analyze usage patterns across all workspaces in your organization. Use this tool to gain insights into how teams are using the platform, track engagement trends, and make data-driven decisions about resource allocation.

## Who Can Access This Feature

Access to Admin Workspaces is restricted to authorized platform administrators only. If you need access and believe you should have administrative privileges, contact your platform administrator.

When you attempt to access the admin area:
- If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to the login page
- If you're logged in but don't have admin permissions, you'll see a "page not found" message
- Only authorized administrators can view and use the analytics dashboard

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Log in to your account with administrator credentials
2. Navigate to the Admin Workspaces page
3. The analytics dashboard will load, showing data from the last 3 months by default

You'll see a comprehensive overview page with summary statistics and visual charts displaying workspace activity.

## Understanding the Dashboard

### Main Dashboard Components

The Admin Workspaces dashboard consists of three main sections:

**Header Section**: Displays the page title "Workspace Analytics" with a brief description explaining that you're viewing cross-workspace usage analytics and insights.

**Filters Section**: Allows you to customize which data you're viewing by selecting specific workspaces and time periods.

**Analytics Section**: Shows summary metrics and visual charts representing workspace usage patterns.

## Filtering Your Data

### Selecting Workspaces

You can focus your analysis on specific workspaces or view data across all workspaces:

1. Use the workspace selector to choose which workspaces you want to analyze
2. Select one or multiple workspaces to compare their activity
3. Leave no workspaces selected to view aggregate data across all workspaces

This is useful when you want to:
- Compare performance between different teams
- Focus on a specific department's usage
- Identify which workspaces are most active

### Setting Time Ranges

Control the time period for your analytics:

1. Set a **start month** to define when your analysis period begins
2. Set an **end month** to define when your analysis period ends
3. The dashboard defaults to showing the last 3 months of data

Use this feature to:
- Track trends over specific quarters
- Compare current activity to previous periods
- Generate reports for specific time frames

## Reading the Analytics

### Summary Metrics

At the top of the analytics section, you'll find summary cards displaying key metrics. These provide a quick snapshot of overall workspace activity and engagement across your selected timeframe.

### Visual Charts

Below the summary metrics, interactive charts help you visualize trends and patterns in workspace usage. These charts update automatically based on your selected filters, allowing you to see how different workspaces perform over time.

## Loading and Error States

### When Data Is Loading

While the dashboard retrieves your analytics data, you'll see a loading indicator. This typically takes just a few seconds.

### If Something Goes Wrong

If there's an issue retrieving your data, you'll see an error message explaining what went wrong. Common issues include:
- Network connectivity problems
- Temporary server issues
- Invalid filter selections

If you encounter an error, try:
1. Refreshing the page
2. Adjusting your filter selections
3. Checking your internet connection

## Best Practices

### Effective Analysis

**Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin by viewing all workspaces to identify trends, then filter to specific workspaces for detailed analysis.

**Compare Time Periods**: Use the month selectors to compare current performance against previous periods and identify seasonal patterns or growth trends.

**Regular Monitoring**: Check the dashboard regularly to stay informed about platform usage and catch potential issues early.

### Making Data-Driven Decisions

Use the insights from Admin Workspaces to:
- Identify high-performing teams and understand their usage patterns
- Detect workspaces that may need additional training or support
- Plan resource allocation based on actual usage data
- Track the impact of new features or organizational changes

## Tips for Administrators

**Multi-Workspace Comparison**: Select multiple workspaces at once to directly compare their activity levels and identify best practices from high-performing teams.

**Historical Trends**: Extend your date range to include several months or quarters to identify long-term trends rather than short-term fluctuations.

**Export Insights**: Use the analytics data to create reports for leadership, demonstrating platform adoption and ROI.

## Privacy and Data Security

As an administrator viewing cross-workspace analytics:
- You're seeing aggregated usage metrics, not individual user activity
- All data is presented in compliance with your organization's privacy policies
- Access to this dashboard is logged for security and audit purposes
