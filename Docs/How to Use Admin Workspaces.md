# How to Use Admin Workspaces

## Overview

Admin Workspaces provides platform administrators with comprehensive analytics and insights across all workspaces in the organization. This powerful tool allows you to monitor usage patterns, track activity trends, and gain visibility into how teams are using the platform.

## Who Can Access This Feature

Access to Admin Workspaces is restricted to authorized platform administrators only. If you don't have administrative privileges, you won't be able to access this feature and will see a "page not found" message instead.

If you're logged out when attempting to access Admin Workspaces, you'll be automatically redirected to the login page and returned to the analytics dashboard after signing in.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Dashboard

Navigate to the Workspace Analytics page to view your administrative dashboard. You'll see a comprehensive overview showing usage analytics and insights across all workspaces.

### Understanding the Interface

The Admin Workspaces dashboard consists of four main areas:

1. **Header Section** - Displays the page title and a brief description of the analytics capabilities
2. **Filters Panel** - Allows you to customize which data you want to view
3. **Summary Cards** - Shows key metrics at a glance
4. **Analytics Charts** - Provides visual representations of usage trends and patterns

## Using the Filters

The filters panel at the top of the dashboard lets you customize your view to focus on specific workspaces or time periods.

### Filtering by Workspace

By default, the dashboard displays data from all workspaces you have access to. To narrow your view:

1. Locate the workspace filter in the filters panel
2. Select one or more specific workspaces from the list
3. The analytics will automatically update to show only data from your selected workspaces

To return to viewing all workspaces, simply clear your workspace selections.

### Selecting a Time Range

The dashboard defaults to showing the last three months of data, but you can adjust this to any timeframe you need:

1. Find the date range controls in the filters panel
2. Set your desired **start month** using the first date selector
3. Set your desired **end month** using the second date selector
4. The analytics will refresh to show data for your selected period

The date filters work on a monthly basis, making it easy to analyze trends over weeks or months.

## Reading the Analytics

### Summary Metrics

The summary cards display high-level statistics that give you an instant understanding of platform usage. These metrics aggregate data across all selected workspaces and time periods, providing quick answers to common questions about platform adoption and activity levels.

### Trend Charts

Below the summary cards, you'll find detailed charts that visualize usage patterns over time. These charts help you:

- Identify trends in platform adoption
- Spot peaks and valleys in activity
- Compare usage across different time periods
- Track growth and engagement metrics

## Tips for Effective Monitoring

### Regular Check-ins

Make it a habit to review the Admin Workspaces dashboard regularly. Weekly or monthly reviews can help you:

- Spot unusual activity patterns early
- Identify workspaces that may need support
- Understand seasonal trends in platform usage
- Make data-driven decisions about resource allocation

### Comparing Time Periods

Use the date range filters to compare different months or quarters. This helps you understand if usage is growing, stable, or declining, and identify what factors might be driving changes.

### Workspace-Specific Analysis

When you notice interesting patterns in the overall data, use the workspace filter to drill down into specific teams or departments. This can help you:

- Understand which teams are power users
- Identify workspaces that might benefit from additional training
- Recognize best practices that could be shared across the organization

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Load

If you see a loading indicator that doesn't complete:

- Check your internet connection
- Refresh the page
- Try selecting a shorter time range (fewer months of data)

### Error Messages

If you encounter an error message displayed in a red box:

- Read the error description carefully
- Try refreshing the page
- Adjust your filters to a different combination
- If the problem persists, contact technical support

### No Data Showing

If the dashboard loads but shows no analytics:

- Verify that your selected workspaces have activity during the chosen time period
- Try expanding your date range to include more months
- Check if any workspaces are actually selected (an empty selection might exclude all data)

## Best Practices

**Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin by viewing all workspaces and a longer time period to understand overall trends, then use filters to investigate specific patterns.

**Track Month-to-Month Changes**: Set up a routine to compare each month against the previous one, helping you stay on top of usage trends.

**Document Insights**: Keep notes about patterns you observe, especially if you notice correlations between platform usage and business events or seasons.

**Share Findings**: Use the insights from Admin Workspaces to inform conversations with team leaders about platform adoption and effectiveness.

## Privacy and Security

The Admin Workspaces feature is designed with security in mind:

- Only authorized administrators can access the dashboard
- Unauthorized users see no indication that the feature exists
- All analytics data is aggregated to protect individual privacy while providing organizational insights

Your administrative access allows you to see cross-workspace data to fulfill your oversight responsibilities while maintaining appropriate boundaries.
