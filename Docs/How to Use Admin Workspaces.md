# How to Use Admin Workspaces

## Overview

The Admin Workspaces feature provides platform administrators with comprehensive analytics and insights across all workspaces. This powerful tool allows you to monitor platform usage, track trends, and gain visibility into organizational activity.

## Access Requirements

Access to Admin Workspaces is restricted to authorized platform administrators only. If you do not have administrative privileges, you will be redirected or shown an error page when attempting to access this feature.

### Getting Access

To access Admin Workspaces:

1. You must be logged into your account
2. Your account must have administrative permissions
3. Navigate to the Workspace Analytics page

If you are not logged in, you will be automatically redirected to the login page. After logging in, you will be returned to the analytics dashboard.

## Understanding the Analytics Dashboard

### Dashboard Overview

When you access the Admin Workspaces dashboard, you'll see:

- **Cross-workspace analytics** - View metrics and usage patterns across multiple workspaces
- **Summary metrics** - Quick overview cards displaying key performance indicators
- **Visual charts** - Graphical representations of usage trends and patterns
- **Filtering options** - Tools to focus your analysis on specific workspaces or time periods

### Time Period Selection

By default, the dashboard displays analytics for the **last 3 months**, starting from three months ago through the current month.

You can adjust the time range to analyze different periods:

1. Locate the date range filters at the top of the page
2. Select your **start month** - the beginning of your analysis period
3. Select your **end month** - the end of your analysis period
4. The dashboard will automatically update to show data for your selected timeframe

## Filtering Workspaces

### Viewing All Workspaces

When you first open the dashboard, analytics are displayed for all workspaces across the platform. This gives you a comprehensive view of overall platform usage.

### Filtering Specific Workspaces

To focus on specific workspaces:

1. Find the workspace filter controls near the top of the page
2. Select one or more workspaces from the available list
3. The analytics will automatically update to show only data from your selected workspaces
4. To return to viewing all workspaces, clear your selections

This filtering capability is useful when you want to:
- Compare performance between specific organizations
- Monitor a particular client or team
- Investigate usage patterns in a subset of workspaces

## Reading the Analytics

### Summary Metrics

At the top of the dashboard, you'll find summary cards displaying:
- Key performance indicators across your selected workspaces
- High-level metrics for quick insights
- Aggregated data for the selected time period

These summary cards provide an at-a-glance view of platform health and usage.

### Analytics Charts

Below the summary section, detailed charts visualize:
- Usage trends over time
- Activity patterns across workspaces
- Comparative metrics between different periods

Use these charts to identify:
- Growth or decline in platform usage
- Seasonal patterns or trends
- Anomalies that may require attention

## Data Loading and Error Handling

### Loading States

When you first access the dashboard or change filters, you'll see a loading indicator while the system retrieves your analytics data. This typically takes just a few moments.

### Error Messages

If there's an issue retrieving analytics data, you'll see an error message describing the problem. Common issues might include:
- Connection problems
- Data retrieval errors
- Permission changes

If you encounter persistent errors, contact your system administrator.

## Best Practices for Using Admin Workspaces

### Regular Monitoring

- Check the dashboard regularly to stay informed about platform usage
- Set a consistent schedule (weekly or monthly) for reviewing analytics
- Note any significant changes or trends for follow-up

### Focused Analysis

- Use workspace filters to investigate specific areas of interest
- Adjust time ranges to compare different periods (month-over-month, year-over-year)
- Export or screenshot key metrics for reporting purposes

### Cross-Workspace Insights

- Compare activity levels between different workspaces
- Identify high-performing or underutilized workspaces
- Use insights to inform resource allocation and support decisions

## Tips for Effective Analytics Review

1. **Start broad, then narrow** - Begin by viewing all workspaces, then filter to investigate specific areas
2. **Look for patterns** - Regular reviews help you establish baseline metrics and identify deviations
3. **Combine metrics** - Use both summary cards and detailed charts together for comprehensive understanding
4. **Track changes over time** - Adjust your date range to see how metrics evolve
5. **Document findings** - Keep notes on significant trends or insights for future reference

## Security and Privacy

The Admin Workspaces feature is designed with security in mind:
- Access is strictly controlled and limited to authorized administrators
- Unauthorized users cannot access administrative analytics
- All data is aggregated and presented in accordance with privacy guidelines

If you believe you should have access but cannot view the dashboard, contact your platform administrator to verify your permissions.
