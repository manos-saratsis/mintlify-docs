## Optimizing Your Credit Usage

### Tips for Managing Costs

**Review your usage patterns**
- Check the Cost Analysis page regularly to understand your consumption
- Identify which days or periods use the most credits

**Adjust analysis frequency**
- Consider running analyses less frequently if approaching your limit
- Schedule important analyses when you have sufficient credits available

**Choose the right plan**
- If you consistently hit your Free plan limits, consider upgrading
- If you're using significantly less than your paid allocation, consider downgrading

**Plan ahead for billing cycles**
- Note your next billing date
- Save complex analyses for early in your billing cycle when credits are plentiful

### Cost Per Analysis

Each code analysis consumes credits based on:
- Repository size
- Number of files analyzed
- Complexity of the codebase

Monitor the credit deduction after each analysis to understand your typical usage patterns.

## Preventing Service Interruptions

**For Free Users**

- Daily limits reset every 24 hours
- Monthly limits reset at the beginning of each month
- Consider upgrading if you need continuous access

**For Paid Users**

- Upgrade to a higher tier if you consistently use your full allocation
- Set reminders to check usage mid-month
