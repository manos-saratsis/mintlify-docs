### Subscription Status

Your subscription status card displays:

- **Billing status**: Active, exceeded, or cancelling
- **Next billing date**: When your subscription renews
- **Credits after renewal**: Your credit allocation for the next period

### Billing Cycle

All credit allocations reset at the beginning of each monthly billing period. Your next billing date shows when your credits will refresh.

## Understanding Billing Status

### Active
Your subscription is current and you have credits available. You can continue using OrchestrAI without interruption.

### Exceeded
You've used all your monthly credits. To continue using OrchestrAI:
- Upgrade to a higher credit tier
- Wait until your next billing period for credits to reset

### Cancelling
Your subscription is set to cancel at the end of the current billing period. You'll retain access until that date, then move to the Free plan.

### Refreshing Your Data

Click the **Refresh** button at any time to sync the latest usage data from your recent analysis activities. This ensures your credit counts are always up to date.

## Optimizing Your Usage

### Tracking Credit Consumption

Monitor your credit usage regularly to:
- Identify usage patterns
- Plan for upcoming projects
- Avoid running out of credits mid-month
- Choose the right credit tier for your needs

### Choosing the Right Plan

Consider these factors when selecting your credit tier:

- **Average monthly usage**: Review past months to estimate needs
- **Project pipeline**: Account for upcoming analysis requirements
- **Team size**: More users typically means higher consumption
- **Analysis frequency**: Daily analyses require more credits than occasional use

### Managing Costs Effectively

**Start conservative**: Begin with a lower tier and upgrade if needed

**Monitor regularly**: Check your usage weekly to stay informed

**Plan ahead**: Upgrade before busy periods rather than mid-month

**Use Free strategically**: For testing or low-volume periods, the Free plan may be sufficient

## Billing Cycle Reset

Credits reset automatically at the start of each billing period. Your unused credits do not roll over to the next month, so plan your usage accordingly.

## Notifications and Alerts

Watch for status indicators on your Cost Analysis page:
- **Green status**: Active subscription with credits available
- **Yellow status**: Approaching your credit limit
- **Red status**: Credits exceeded or subscription cancelling
- **Blue notification**: Scheduled plan change pending

- Unexpected charges
