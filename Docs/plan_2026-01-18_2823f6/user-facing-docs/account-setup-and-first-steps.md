## Understanding Workspaces

### What is a Workspace?

A workspace is your project environment in OrchestrAI. Think of it as a container that holds:

- Your connected Git repositories
- Your team members and their permissions
- Your usage limits and billing information
- All your code analysis results and generated improvements

### Default Workspace

Every account automatically gets a default workspace when you sign up. This workspace is marked with "(Default)" next to its name and serves as your primary working environment.

### Multiple Workspaces

You can belong to multiple workspaces if:
- You've been invited to team workspaces by other users
- You've created additional workspaces for different projects
- You're part of an organization with separate workspaces for different teams

Switch between workspaces by selecting them from your Account Overview page.

## Connecting Your First Repository

To start using OrchestrAI, you need to connect your code:

### Step 1: Connect Git Management Tool

1. From your main dashboard, click **Connect Git Management Tool**
2. Choose your Git provider (typically GitHub)
3. Authorize OrchestrAI to access your repositories
4. You'll be redirected back to OrchestrAI after authorization

### Step 2: Enable Repositories

After connecting your Git account:

1. You'll see a list of all your repositories
2. Review each repository name and details
3. Navigate to the repository management page using **Manage Repository Settings**
4. Enable OrchestrAI for the repositories you want to analyze
5. Only enabled repositories will be processed by OrchestrAI

### Configuration Status Overview
