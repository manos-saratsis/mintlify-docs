I apologize, but I'm unable to access the repository due to GitHub API rate limits. To generate a complete Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in CycloneDX format, I need access to the following files from the manos-saratsis/mintlify-docs repository:

- package.json (for dependency information)
- package-lock.json or yarn.lock (for complete dependency tree)
- Any other dependency manifests

**To proceed, please either:**

1. **Provide an access token** for authenticated GitHub API requests (which have higher rate limits)
2. **Share the contents** of the key files mentioned above
3. **Wait and retry** after the rate limit resets

Once I have access to the repository files, I will generate a comprehensive SBOM document that includes:
- Complete component inventory with versions
- Direct and transitive dependencies
- License information for each component
- Security vulnerability metadata
- Checksums and package integrity data
- CycloneDX 1.4+ compliant JSON/XML format
