# How to Use Admin Workspaces

The Admin Workspaces page provides platform administrators with powerful tools to monitor and analyze activity across multiple workspaces. This centralized dashboard helps you track usage patterns, view performance metrics, and gain insights into how your organization uses the platform.

## Who Can Access This Feature

Access to Admin Workspaces is restricted to authorized platform administrators only. If you don't have administrative privileges, you won't be able to view this page. Contact your system administrator if you believe you should have access.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the Admin Workspaces section from your main menu. Once there, you'll see a comprehensive analytics dashboard displaying usage data across all workspaces you have permission to monitor.

## Understanding the Dashboard

### Overview Display

When you first open the page, you'll see:

- **Page Title**: "Workspace Analytics" with a description explaining this is for cross-workspace insights
- **Summary Cards**: Quick statistics showing key metrics at a glance
- **Interactive Charts**: Visual representations of usage data and trends
- **Filter Controls**: Tools to customize what data you're viewing

### Time Range Selection

The dashboard automatically displays data from the last 3 months by default. You can adjust this time period to focus on specific timeframes:

1. Use the date filters at the top of the page
2. Select a start month to begin your analysis period
3. Select an end month to complete your analysis period
4. The dashboard updates automatically to show data for your selected range

## Filtering Your View

### Workspace Selection

View analytics for specific workspaces or all workspaces at once:

1. Locate the workspace filter controls near the top of the page
2. Click to select one or more specific workspaces
3. Leave all workspaces unselected to view data across all available workspaces
4. Your selection updates the entire dashboard instantly

### Customizing Date Ranges

Adjust the time period to match your reporting needs:

- Choose monthly intervals that align with your business reporting cycles
- Compare different time periods by changing the date range
- Track trends over time by selecting broader date ranges

## Viewing Analytics

### Summary Metrics

The summary section provides quick insights into overall platform usage. These high-level statistics help you quickly assess activity levels and identify trends without diving into detailed charts.

### Visual Analytics

Interactive charts display your workspace data in easy-to-understand formats:

- **Usage Trends**: See how activity changes over time
- **Comparative Data**: Compare metrics across different workspaces
- **Performance Indicators**: Monitor key performance metrics

Charts automatically update when you change filters, allowing you to explore data from different angles.

## Common Administrative Tasks

### Monitoring Overall Activity

To get a quick snapshot of platform health:

1. View the page with no workspace filters applied (showing all workspaces)
2. Review the summary cards for overall statistics
3. Check the charts for any unusual patterns or trends

### Analyzing Specific Workspaces

To investigate particular workspace performance:

1. Use the workspace filter to select the workspace(s) you want to analyze
2. Review the filtered metrics in the summary cards
3. Examine the charts to understand usage patterns for those specific workspaces

### Comparing Time Periods

To analyze changes over time:

1. Set your initial date range and note the metrics
2. Adjust the date range to a different period
3. Compare the results to identify growth, decline, or seasonal patterns

## Tips for Effective Monitoring

**Regular Check-ins**: Review the dashboard weekly or monthly to stay informed about platform usage and quickly spot any anomalies.

**Baseline Understanding**: Familiarize yourself with normal usage patterns so you can quickly identify when something is unusual.

**Filtered Analysis**: Use workspace filters when investigating specific issues or when you need detailed information about particular teams or departments.

**Time Range Flexibility**: Adjust date ranges based on your needs—use shorter ranges for recent activity monitoring and longer ranges for trend analysis.

## What to Do If You Encounter Issues

**Page Won't Load**: If the dashboard shows a loading indicator for an extended period, refresh your browser and try again.

**Error Messages**: If you see an error message on the page, note the message details and contact your technical support team. The system will display specific error information to help diagnose the issue.

**Access Denied**: If you're redirected away from the page or see a "not found" message, you may not have the required administrative permissions. Contact your system administrator to verify your access level.

**Missing Data**: If charts or metrics appear empty, verify that your selected date range and workspace filters are appropriate and that there is activity during the selected period.

## Understanding Your Analytics

The Admin Workspaces dashboard aggregates data from across your entire platform, giving you visibility into how teams use the system. Use this information to:

- Make informed decisions about resource allocation
- Identify which workspaces are most active
- Track adoption and engagement over time
- Plan for capacity and growth needs
- Recognize usage patterns that might indicate training opportunities

Remember that data updates based on actual platform activity, so the most recent information reflects real-time usage across your organization.
