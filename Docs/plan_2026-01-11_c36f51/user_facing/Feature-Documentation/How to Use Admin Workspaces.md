# How to Use Admin Workspaces

## Overview

The Admin Workspaces feature provides platform administrators with comprehensive analytics and insights across all workspaces. This powerful administrative tool allows you to monitor usage patterns, track activity trends, and analyze platform engagement from a centralized dashboard.

## Access Requirements

Access to Admin Workspaces is restricted to authorized platform administrators only. If you don't have administrative privileges, you won't be able to view this feature. When you attempt to access administrative tools:

- You must be logged into your account
- Your account must have administrative authorization
- Unauthorized users will be automatically redirected or shown an error page

Contact your platform administrator if you believe you should have access but cannot view the Admin Workspaces feature.

## Getting Started

When you open the Admin Workspaces feature, you'll see:

1. **Page Header**: Displays "Workspace Analytics" with a description of the tool's purpose
2. **Filter Controls**: Options to customize the data you're viewing
3. **Summary Cards**: Quick overview metrics at a glance
4. **Analytics Charts**: Visual representations of workspace activity and trends

The page automatically loads data for the last 3 months when you first access it.

## Using the Filters

The filtering options at the top of the page help you focus on specific data:

### Time Range Selection

Choose the date range for your analysis:

- **Start Month**: Select the beginning month for your analysis period
- **End Month**: Select the ending month for your analysis period
- The system defaults to showing the most recent 3 months of data

### Workspace Selection

Filter data by specific workspaces:

- View a list of all available workspaces
- Select one or multiple workspaces to analyze
- Leave all workspaces unselected to view platform-wide data across all workspaces
- Selected workspaces will be highlighted for easy reference

After adjusting any filters, the dashboard automatically updates to reflect your selections.

## Understanding the Analytics

### Summary Metrics

The summary section displays key performance indicators that provide a quick snapshot of workspace activity:

- View aggregate statistics across selected workspaces
- Metrics update based on your filter selections
- Compare performance across different time periods

### Analytics Charts

Visual charts help you identify trends and patterns:

- **Usage Trends**: See how workspace activity changes over time
- **Activity Patterns**: Understand when and how users engage with workspaces
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare metrics across different workspaces or time periods

All charts are interactive and respond to your filter selections, making it easy to drill down into specific areas of interest.

## Page States

### Loading State

When the page is gathering data, you'll see:

- A loading indicator in the center of the screen
- This typically appears briefly when first accessing the page or after changing filters

### Error State

If there's an issue retrieving data:

- An error message will appear in a highlighted box
- The message explains what went wrong
- Try refreshing the page or adjusting your filters if you encounter errors

### No Data Available

If your filter selections return no results:

## Best Practices

**Regular Monitoring**: Check analytics regularly to stay informed about platform usage and identify trends early.

**Compare Time Periods**: Use the date filters to compare activity across different months to spot seasonal patterns or growth trends.

**Focus Your Analysis**: Select specific workspaces when you need detailed insights about particular teams or projects.
