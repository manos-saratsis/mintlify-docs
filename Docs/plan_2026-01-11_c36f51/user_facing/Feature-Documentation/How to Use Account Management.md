# How to Use Account Management

## Overview

Account Management is your central hub for monitoring and managing your OrchestrAI workspaces. Here you can view all your workspaces, check their status, monitor usage, and access detailed cost analysis.

## Accessing Your Account

## Understanding Your Workspace Overview

### Workspace Cards

Each workspace appears as a card displaying key information:

- **Workspace Name**: The name you've given to your workspace
- **Workspace ID**: A unique identifier for reference
- **Plan Type**: Your current subscription plan (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise)
- **Default Indicator**: Shows if this is your default workspace
- **Status Badge**: Displays your billing status with color-coded indicators:
  - **Active**: Your workspace is operating normally
  - **Reached Limits**: You've hit your usage limits
  - **Paused**: Your workspace is temporarily paused
  - **Closed**: Your workspace has been closed

## Monitoring Usage

### Viewing Usage History

To see how you're using your credits:

1. Locate the workspace you want to monitor
2. Click the **Usage** button on the workspace card
3. A detailed usage window will appear showing:
   - Monthly usage breakdown
   - Credit consumption patterns
   - Activity history

This helps you understand how your credits are being spent and plan accordingly.

### Accessing Cost Analysis

For a deeper dive into your spending:

1. Find the workspace you want to analyze
2. Click the **Cost Analysis** button
3. You'll be taken to a detailed cost analysis dashboard showing:
   - Spending trends over time
   - Cost breakdowns by activity
   - Historical comparison data

## Understanding Your Workspace Status

### Active Status

Your workspace is fully operational with available credits. You can continue using all features without interruption.

### Reached Limits

You've consumed your allocated credits for the billing period. Consider upgrading your plan or waiting for your credits to refresh.

### Paused Status

Your workspace is temporarily inactive. Contact support or check your billing settings to resolve any issues.

### Closed Status

This workspace is no longer active. You may need to create a new workspace or reactivate this one.

## Managing Multiple Workspaces

If you have multiple workspaces, you can:

- **Compare usage** across different workspaces by viewing their individual usage reports
- **Identify your default workspace** by looking for the "(Default)" indicator
- **Monitor each workspace separately** using their individual Usage and Cost Analysis buttons

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring

- Check your usage regularly to avoid hitting limits unexpectedly
- Review cost analysis monthly to optimize your spending
- Keep track of which workspace is your default to ensure tasks run in the correct environment

### Usage Planning

- Monitor your usage patterns to choose the right plan
- Set up regular reviews of your cost analysis
- Plan ahead if you anticipate increased usage

## Getting Help
