# Understanding Workspaces and Organization

## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is your main organizational container in OrchestrAI. Think of it as a shared space where you keep all your projects, team members, and settings together. Whether you're working solo or with a team, workspaces help you keep everything organized in one place.

## Personal vs Team Workspaces

### Personal Workspaces

When you first sign up, OrchestrAI creates a default workspace for you automatically. This is your personal workspace where you can:

- Store your individual projects and repositories
- Experiment and test features
- Work independently without sharing access

### Team Workspaces

You can create additional workspaces designed for team collaboration. Team workspaces allow you to:

- Share projects with multiple team members
- Control who can access what through member roles
- Collaborate on the same repositories
- Manage team access centrally

## Creating and Managing Workspaces

### Creating a New Workspace

To create a new workspace:

1. Navigate to the Workspace Management page from your dashboard
2. Click the "New Workspace" button in the top right
3. Enter a name for your workspace
4. Click "Create"

Your new workspace is immediately available and ready to use.

### Renaming a Workspace

To change a workspace's name:

1. Go to Workspace Management
2. Find the workspace in your list
3. Click the edit icon next to the workspace name
4. Enter the new name
5. Click "Save"

### Switching Between Workspaces

You can easily switch between your workspaces:

1. Locate the workspace in your workspace list
2. Click the "Switch" button next to it

The workspace you select becomes your active workspace, and you'll see all projects and settings associated with it. OrchestrAI remembers your last selected workspace, so when you return, you'll be right where you left off.

### Deleting a Workspace

To remove a workspace you no longer need:

1. Go to Workspace Management
2. Find the workspace you want to delete
3. Click the delete icon (trash can)
4. Confirm the deletion

**Important:** You must always have at least one workspace. OrchestrAI won't let you delete your last workspace.

## Team Collaboration

### Inviting Team Members

To add someone to your workspace:

1. Go to Workspace Management
2. Find the workspace you want to share
3. Click the "Invite" icon (person with plus sign)
4. Enter their email address
5. Click "Send Invitation"

The person will receive an invitation email. Once they accept, they'll appear in your workspace members list.

### Understanding Member Roles

OrchestrAI uses three member roles to control access:

**Owner**
- Full control over the workspace
- Can invite and remove members
- Can change workspace settings
- Can delete the workspace
- Created automatically when you create a workspace

**Admin**
- Can manage projects and repositories
- Can invite members
- Can update workspace settings
- Cannot delete the workspace

**Member**
- Can access and work on projects
- Can view workspace information
- Limited administrative capabilities

### Viewing Your Team

To see who has access to a workspace:

1. Go to Workspace Management
2. Find the workspace in your list
3. View the "Members" column to see the member count
4. Click on the workspace to see detailed member information

For each member, you can see:
- Their email address or identifier
- When they joined the workspace
- Their role (Owner, Admin, or Member)

### Managing Pending Invitations

Invitations that haven't been accepted yet appear in the "Pending Invitations" section. Here you can:

- See who has been invited
- View when the invitation was sent
- Track invitation status

### Leaving a Workspace

If you're a member of a workspace you no longer need access to:

1. Navigate to Workspace Management
2. Find the workspace
3. Select the option to leave the workspace

When you leave, you'll lose access to all projects and repositories in that workspace. You cannot leave a workspace if you're the owner and there are other members—you'll need to transfer ownership or remove other members first.

## Organizing Multiple Projects

### When to Create Multiple Workspaces

Consider creating separate workspaces when you need to:

- Separate personal and professional work
- Isolate different client projects
- Create distinct team environments
- Maintain separate billing or subscription plans

### Best Practices for Workspace Organization

**For Individual Users:**
- Keep your default workspace for personal projects
- Create additional workspaces for different areas of work
- Use clear, descriptive names like "Personal Projects" or "Freelance Work"

**For Teams:**
- Create one workspace per team or department
- Name workspaces after teams or project areas (e.g., "Marketing Team", "Product Development")
- Keep related repositories together in the same workspace
- Regularly review team member access

**For Organizations:**
- Structure workspaces by department or product line
- Assign workspace ownership to team leads
- Document workspace purposes for team clarity
- Establish naming conventions early

## Workspace Settings and Information

### What You Can See

For each workspace, you can view:

- **Workspace Name**: The identifier you chose
- **Creation Date**: When the workspace was created
- **Member Count**: How many people have access
- **Git Connections**: Number of repositories connected (when available)
- **Default Status**: Whether this is your default workspace

### Active Workspace Indicator

The workspace you're currently using is marked as "Current" in your workspace list. This helps you stay oriented when managing multiple workspaces.

## Common Scenarios

### Starting Fresh

When you create a new account, OrchestrAI sets up your first workspace automatically. You can start working immediately—no setup required.

### Growing Your Team

As your team expands:
1. Invite new members as they join
2. Assign appropriate roles based on responsibilities
3. Consider creating additional workspaces for different teams or projects

### Managing Multiple Projects

When juggling several projects:
1. Use workspaces to separate unrelated work
2. Switch between workspaces as needed
3. Keep team members organized by adding them only to relevant workspaces

### Reorganizing Your Work

If you need to restructure:
1. Create new workspaces with your desired organization
2. Invite team members to the appropriate workspaces
3. Archive or delete old workspaces you no longer need

## Workspace Limitations and Requirements

- You must maintain at least one workspace at all times
- You must be signed in to create or manage workspaces
- Each workspace requires a unique name within your account
- Workspace owners cannot leave until ownership is transferred or the workspace is deleted

## Tips for Success

**Keep It Simple**: Don't create too many workspaces. More isn't always better—it can make navigation confusing.

**Name Clearly**: Use descriptive names that make it obvious what each workspace contains.

**Review Regularly**: Periodically check your workspace members and remove access for people who no longer need it.

**Start Small**: Begin with one or two workspaces and add more only as needed.

**Communicate**: Let your team know which workspace to use for which projects.

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues with workspaces:
- Check that you're signed in to your account
- Verify you have the correct role permissions
- Ensure you're viewing the correct workspace
- Try refreshing the page if information seems outdated

Workspaces form the foundation of how you organize work in OrchestrAI. Understanding how to use them effectively will help you and your team stay organized and productive.
