# Credits, Billing, and Usage Limits

## Overview

OrchestrAI uses a credit-based billing system where credits are consumed when AI agents perform analyses, process files, write code, or generate documentation. This flexible pricing model ensures you only pay for what you actually use.

## Understanding Credits

A credit is the unit of measurement for OrchestrAI operations. When AI agents analyze your code or perform actions—either on demand or as part of automated workflows—they consume credits based on the complexity of the operation.

**Credit consumption varies by task:**
- Simple operations may cost less than 1 credit
- Complex analyses or multi-file processing may cost several credits
- Each action has a different cost depending on the situation and complexity

This usage-based approach means your costs scale with your actual usage rather than fixed flat rates.

## How Billing Works

### Monthly Billing Cycle

Credits are allocated monthly and reset at the beginning of each billing cycle. Your billing cycle starts on the day you subscribe to a paid plan.

### Credit Tracking

You can monitor your credit usage in real-time:
- Navigate to the Cost Analysis page for your workspace
- View your current monthly usage against your credit limit
- See exactly how many credits remain for the current billing period
- Track usage separately for free credits and paid credits

The system displays:
- **Monthly Credit Usage:** Shows credits used out of your total allocation
- **Credits Remaining:** Calculates how many credits you have left this month
- **Usage Progress:** Visual progress bar indicating your consumption rate

### Credit Types

**Free Credits:** Used by workspaces on the Free plan (50 credits/month)

**Paid Credits:** Used by workspaces on Pro plans with purchased credit allocations

The system tracks these separately to provide clear visibility into your usage patterns.
