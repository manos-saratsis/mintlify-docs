# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### What is OrchestrAI?

OrchestrAI helps bring your code more ready for production by automating key development tasks including testing, quality analysis, compliance checks, security scanning, documentation generation, and instrumentation.

### How do I get started with OrchestrAI?

To begin using OrchestrAI:

1. Create an account and sign in
2. Connect your Git management tool (currently GitHub)
3. Enable OrchestrAI on your repositories
4. Start using the available features from your dashboard

### What do I need to connect to use OrchestrAI?

You need to connect your GitHub account to get started. Once connected, you can enable OrchestrAI to work with your public and private repositories.

### Do I need to install anything for OrchestrAI to work?

### How many repositories can I connect?

- **Free Plan**: 1 public repository
- **Pro Plan**: All your public and private repositories

## Billing and Pricing

### What is a credit?

Credits are used when OrchestrAI analyzes your code or performs actions, either on demand or as part of automated workflows. It's usage-based pricing where requests can cost less than 1 credit or several credits, depending on their complexity. This ensures you only pay for what you actually use.

Since OrchestrAI agents perform many analyses, process multiple files, and write code or documentation, each action can have a different cost for different situations.

### What plans are available?

**Free Plan** - $0/month
- 50 monthly credits
- 1 public repository
- 5 collaborators
- Credits reset at the beginning of each month

**Pro Plan** - Starting at $25/month
- Customizable monthly credits (100 to 5,000+)
- All your public and private repositories
- Unlimited collaborators
- Role-based access control

### How much does the Pro plan cost?

The Pro plan is flexible and based on your credit needs:
- 100 credits: $25/month
- 200 credits: $50/month
- 400 credits: $100/month
- 1,000 credits: $250/month
- 2,000 credits: $500/month
- 3,000 credits: $750/month
- 5,000 credits: $1,250/month

### How many workflows can I run on the Free plan?

With the Free plan's 50 credits per month and no daily restrictions, you can typically run 3-4 complete AI workflows per month.

### When do my credits reset?

Credits reset at the beginning of each month for all plans.

### Can I change my plan?

Yes, you can edit your plan at any time by visiting the Cost Analysis page for your workspace. You can upgrade from Free to Pro, or adjust your monthly credit allocation on the Pro plan.

### How can I track my credit usage?

You can view your usage history by:
1. Going to your Account page
2. Selecting "Usage" for any workspace
3. Viewing detailed monthly usage reports

You can also access the Cost Analysis page to see spending trends and projections.

### Can I forecast how many credits I'll need?

Soon you will be able to forecast the approximate costs of a workflow or an AI execution before you run it.

### What happens if I run out of credits?

When you run out of credits, you'll see a notification and won't be able to run additional analyses until your credits reset at the beginning of the next month, or you upgrade your plan to include more credits.

## Troubleshooting

### I connected GitHub but don't see my repositories

Make sure you've granted OrchestrAI permission to access your repositories during the GitHub connection process. You may need to reconnect and authorize access to specific repositories or organizations.

### How do I enable a repository?

1. Navigate to the Code page from your dashboard
2. Find your repository in the list
3. Enable OrchestrAI for that repository
4. The repository will now appear in your enabled repositories list

### The OrchestrAI Bot shows as not connected

Install the OrchestrAI Bot by clicking the "Install Bot" link on your dashboard or visiting the GitHub Apps installation page directly. The bot needs to be installed on your repositories for OrchestrAI to create pull requests and commits.

### I'm not seeing recent analysis results

Check that:
- Your repository is enabled for OrchestrAI
- You have sufficient credits available
- The OrchestrAI Bot is installed on your repository
- You're viewing the correct workspace

### How do I view analysis results?

Analysis results appear on the respective feature pages:
- Testing results include pull request links
- Code Quality and Compliance show issue counts and scores
- Security scans display vulnerability counts
- Documentation tasks show completion status

Each feature card on your dashboard shows the most recent analysis date and status.

### Where can I see pull requests or commits created by OrchestrAI?

When OrchestrAI completes an analysis that generates code changes:
- Testing and Instrumentation results include direct links to pull requests
- You can also view these in your GitHub repository's pull requests section
- Look for pull requests created by the OrchestrAI Bot

## Privacy and Security

### Is my code secure?

OrchestrAI connects to your repositories through secure OAuth connections and the OrchestrAI Bot uses GitHub's security infrastructure. You maintain full control over your code.

### Who can see my code?

Only workspace members you've invited have access to your repositories through OrchestrAI. Access is controlled through workspace membership and role-based permissions.

### Can I remove OrchestrAI's access?

Yes, you can revoke OrchestrAI's access at any time by:
- Disconnecting your Git connection in the Code settings
- Uninstalling the OrchestrAI Bot from GitHub
- Removing repository enablement
