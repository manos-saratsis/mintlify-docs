# Understanding Workspaces and Organization

## What is a Workspace?

A workspace is your organizational home in OrchestrAI. Think of it as a container that holds everything related to your AI projects—your repositories, team members, and billing information all live within a workspace.

Every user needs at least one workspace to use OrchestrAI. When you first sign up, a default workspace is created for you automatically.

## Personal vs Team Workspaces

### Personal Workspaces

When you create your first workspace, it starts as a personal workspace where you're the sole owner. Personal workspaces are ideal for:

- Individual projects and experimentation
- Learning and exploring OrchestrAI features
- Managing your own AI repositories
- Projects that don't require collaboration

### Team Workspaces

You can transform any workspace into a team workspace by inviting others to join. Team workspaces enable:

- Collaboration with colleagues on shared projects
- Centralized billing for your organization
- Consistent access controls across your team
- Organized project management at scale

## Creating and Managing Workspaces

### Creating a New Workspace

You can create multiple workspaces to organize different aspects of your work. For example, you might have separate workspaces for different clients, departments, or project types.

To create a new workspace:
1. Navigate to your workspace settings
2. Select the option to create a new workspace
3. Give it a descriptive name that reflects its purpose
4. The new workspace is created immediately and you become its owner

### Switching Between Workspaces

OrchestrAI remembers which workspace you were last using, so when you return to the platform, you'll automatically see the same workspace. To switch to a different workspace:

1. Open the workspace selector
2. Choose the workspace you want to work in
3. All your repositories and settings will update to reflect the selected workspace

### Renaming or Updating Workspaces

Workspace owners and administrators can update workspace details at any time:

- Change the workspace name to better reflect its current purpose
- Update billing plan settings as your needs grow
- Modify workspace settings and preferences

### Deleting Workspaces

If you no longer need a workspace, owners can delete it. However, you must always maintain at least one active workspace—the system prevents you from deleting your last workspace.

**Important:** When you delete a workspace, all associated repositories, settings, and team memberships are permanently removed.

## Team Collaboration

### Inviting Team Members

Workspace owners and administrators can invite others to join by email. When you invite someone:

1. Enter their email address in the team management section
2. They receive an invitation to join your workspace
3. Once they accept, they become active members with access to workspace resources

Invited members must accept the invitation before they can access the workspace.

### Member Roles and Permissions

OrchestrAI uses three distinct roles to control what team members can do within a workspace:

#### Owner

The workspace owner has complete control and can:
- Manage all workspace settings
- Invite and remove team members
- Change member roles
- Update billing and plan information
- Delete the workspace
- Access all repositories and resources

#### Administrator

Administrators help manage the workspace and can:
- Invite new team members
- Update member roles (except owner)
- Manage workspace resources
- Access all repositories
- Configure workspace settings

#### Member

Regular members have standard access to:
- View and work with repositories they're assigned to
- Collaborate on projects within the workspace
- Access shared resources

Members cannot manage team settings or billing.

### Managing Team Members

Workspace administrators can manage the team in several ways:

**Changing Member Roles**
You can promote members to administrators or adjust roles as your team's needs evolve. This helps you delegate management responsibilities appropriately.

**Deactivating Members**
When someone leaves your team or project, you can deactivate their access. Deactivated members:
- Lose immediate access to the workspace
- Remain in the system for 90 days in case reactivation is needed
- Are automatically cleaned up after 3 months if not reactivated

This temporary deactivation provides a safety window if someone needs their access restored.

**Reactivating Members**
If a deactivated member needs to rejoin, administrators can reactivate their account instead of sending a new invitation, preserving their previous role and history.

### Leaving a Workspace

If you're a member of multiple workspaces and want to leave one:

1. Open the workspace settings
2. Select the option to leave the workspace
3. Confirm your decision
4. You'll automatically switch to one of your remaining workspaces

**Note:** Workspace owners cannot leave their workspace—they must first transfer ownership to another member or delete the workspace entirely.

## Workspaces and Billing

### How Billing Works

Each workspace has its own billing plan and subscription. This means:

- Billing is tied to the workspace, not to individual users
- The workspace owner manages billing and plan selection
- All team members within a workspace share the same plan benefits
- Different workspaces can have different billing plans

### Managing Multiple Workspaces

If you're a member of several workspaces:
- You don't pay separately for each workspace you join
- The workspace owner handles billing for their workspace
- You only pay for workspaces you own

This structure allows organizations to centralize costs while giving individuals the flexibility to collaborate across multiple teams.

### Plan Changes

Workspace owners can upgrade or downgrade plans as needed. Plan changes:
- Apply to the entire workspace immediately
- Affect all members' access to features
- Are billed according to the workspace's billing cycle

## Best Practices for Organizing Workspaces

### Structure by Purpose

Consider creating separate workspaces for:

**By Business Function**
- Engineering workspace for development projects
- Marketing workspace for AI-powered campaigns
- Data Science workspace for research initiatives

**By Client or Customer**
- Individual workspaces for each client project
- Clear separation of access and billing
- Professional organization of deliverables

**By Project Stage**
- Development workspace for active projects
- Production workspace for deployed solutions
- Testing workspace for experiments

### Keep Teams Focused

- Don't create too many workspaces—it can become confusing
- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Regularly review and consolidate unused workspaces
- Ensure team members know which workspace to use for each project

### Manage Permissions Thoughtfully

- Start with minimal permissions and expand as needed
- Regularly review team membership
- Remove access for team members who no longer need it
- Promote trusted team members to administrators to share management duties

### Plan for Growth

- Start with a simple workspace structure
- Add new workspaces as your needs evolve
- Document which workspace serves which purpose
- Communicate workspace organization to your team

## Common Scenarios

### Freelancer or Consultant

Create separate workspaces for:
- Your personal projects (personal workspace)
- Each client engagement (client-specific workspaces)
- Experimental or learning projects (sandbox workspace)

This keeps client work isolated and billing separate.

### Small Team or Startup

Start with:
- One primary workspace for your core product
- Add team members as your company grows
- Create additional workspaces as you expand into new product lines

### Enterprise Organization

Structure by:
- Department or business unit
- Geographic region or office location
- Project or product line
- Environment (development, staging, production)

Assign administrators in each workspace to distribute management responsibilities.

## Understanding Workspace Context

### What's Affected by Workspace Selection

When you select a workspace, you're viewing:
- Only the repositories within that workspace
- Team members who have access to that workspace
- Settings and configurations specific to that workspace
- Billing information for that workspace (if you're the owner)

### What's Not Affected

Your workspace selection doesn't change:
- Your personal account settings
- Your profile information
- Your authentication or security settings
- Access to other workspaces you're a member of

## Key Takeaways

1. **Workspaces are organizational containers** that group repositories, team members, and billing together

2. **You must have at least one workspace** but can create as many as needed to organize your work

3. **Each workspace has its own team structure** with owners, administrators, and members who have different permission levels

4. **Billing is per workspace**, allowing flexible cost management for organizations

5. **Team collaboration happens within workspaces**, making it easy to control who has access to what

6. **Switching workspaces is seamless**, and the platform remembers your last selection

7. **Structure your workspaces thoughtfully** based on your organizational needs, whether you're an individual, small team, or large enterprise

By understanding how workspaces function, you can effectively organize your AI projects, collaborate with your team, and manage access and billing in a way that makes sense for your organization.
