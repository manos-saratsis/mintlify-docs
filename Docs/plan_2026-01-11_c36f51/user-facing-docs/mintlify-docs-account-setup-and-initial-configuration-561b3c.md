## Understanding Workspaces

A **workspace** is your central hub in OrchestrAI where you manage your repositories, team members, and AI workflows. Think of it as your project home base.

### What is a Workspace?

When you create your OrchestrAI account, a workspace is automatically created for you. Your workspace contains:

- **Your repositories**: The code projects you connect to OrchestrAI
- **Team members**: People you invite to collaborate with you
- **Usage credits**: Your monthly allowance for AI operations
- **Billing information**: Your current plan and payment details

### Your Default Workspace

Your first workspace is marked as your "Default" workspace. This is the workspace you'll use when you first start with OrchestrAI. You can view this on your Account Overview page where you'll see:

- Workspace name
- Workspace ID (a unique identifier)
- Current plan (Free, Pro, or Enterprise)
- Billing status
- Whether it's your default workspace

## Choosing Your Plan

OrchestrAI offers two main plans to fit different needs and team sizes. All plans use a credit-based system where credits are consumed when AI performs actions on your behalf.

### What Are Credits?

**Credits** are how OrchestrAI measures usage. When you ask OrchestrAI to analyze code, generate documentation, or perform other AI-powered actions, credits are consumed. The number of credits used depends on the complexity of the task:

- Simple operations might use less than 1 credit
- Complex operations (like analyzing multiple files or writing extensive code) might use several credits
- A complete AI workflow typically uses 12-15 credits

This usage-based approach ensures you only pay for what you actually use.

### Free Plan ($0/month)

Perfect for individuals getting started with OrchestrAI.

**What you get:**
- **50 monthly credits** (typically 3-4 complete AI workflows per month)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I forecast my credit usage?

OrchestrAI will soon offer the ability to estimate the approximate cost of a workflow or AI operation before you run it. This will help you budget your credits more effectively and avoid surprises.

### Who owns the code and documentation OrchestrAI generates?

You do. All code and documentation generated by OrchestrAI belongs to you. You can:
- Collaborate directly at the source
- Check out your changes using Git
- Integrate with GitHub (currently supported)
- Use GitLab and Bitbucket (coming soon)

### What if I need help choosing a plan?

Consider these questions:
- **How many repositories do you need to connect?** If it's just one public repo, start with Free. If you need multiple or private repos, choose Pro.
- **How large is your team?** Up to 5 people? Free works. Larger team? Go with Pro.
- **How often will you use OrchestrAI?** The Free plan gives you 3-4 workflows per month. If you need more, Pro offers flexible credit options.

### Can I change my plan later?

Yes! You can upgrade, downgrade, or adjust your credit allocation at any time from either the Pricing page or your Account Overview page. Changes take effect on your next billing cycle.

### What happens to my workspaces if I downgrade?

Your workspace data remains safe. However, you may lose access to certain features like:
- Private repositories (on Free plan, only 1 public repository is allowed)
- Unlimited collaborators (Free plan limits to 5)
- Role-based access controls
