# Credits, Billing, and Usage Limits

## Overview

OrchestrAI uses a credit-based billing system where credits are consumed when AI agents perform analyses, process files, write code, or generate documentation. This flexible, usage-based approach ensures you only pay for what you actually use.

## Understanding Credits

A credit is the unit of measurement for OrchestrAI's AI-powered operations. When you request an analysis or run a workflow, the system consumes credits based on the complexity of the task.

**Key characteristics:**
- Individual requests can cost less than 1 credit or several credits depending on complexity
- Different analyses and actions have different credit costs
- Processing multiple files or performing complex operations uses more credits
- Credits are consumed in real-time as work is performed

## Plan Types

## How Credits Are Used

Credits are consumed when OrchestrAI agents:
- Analyze your codebase
- Process and examine files
- Generate code or documentation
- Perform actions as part of workflows
- Execute on-demand analyses

The exact credit cost varies based on:
- Task complexity
- Number of files processed
- Depth of analysis required
- Type of operation performed

## Monitoring Your Usage

### Viewing Credit Usage

Navigate to the Cost Analysis page to view your workspace's current usage:

**Monthly Credit Usage** shows:
- Credits used in the current billing period
- Total monthly credit limit
- Remaining credits available
- Progress bar showing percentage used

**Example displays:**
- Free Plan: "15.5 / 50 credits" with "34.5 credits remaining this month"
- Pro Plan: "250.0 / 1000 credits" with "750.0 credits remaining this month"

### Real-Time Updates

The Cost Analysis page includes a Refresh button to sync your latest usage data and ensure you're seeing current information.

## Subscription Management

### Billing Status

Your subscription can have several statuses:
- **Active** - Your plan is active and credits are available
- **Exceeded** - You've used all available credits for the month
- **Cancelling at period end** - Your subscription will end after the current billing period

### Next Billing Date

The Cost Analysis page displays when your next billing cycle begins and when credits will reset. For paid plans, this shows when your subscription will renew.

### Managing Your Plan

**For Free Plan users:**
Click "Upgrade to Paid" to select a Pro plan tier and add credits to your account.

**For Pro Plan users:**
- **Edit Plan** - Change your monthly credit limit or switch plans
- **Manage Billing** - Access payment methods, billing history, and invoices

## Plan Changes and Billing Cycles

### Upgrading Your Plan

When you upgrade from Free to Pro or increase your credit limit:
- Changes take effect immediately
- You're billed for the new amount
- Your new credit limit is available right away

### Downgrading or Cancelling

When you downgrade or cancel your subscription:
- Your current plan continues until the end of the billing period
- You retain access to all paid features until that date
- After the billing period ends, you'll move to the new plan level
- If cancelling, you'll automatically move to the Free plan (50 credits/month)

**Scheduled changes** are displayed with clear notifications:
- "Will downgrade to Free plan (50 credits/month) after current period"
- "New plan scheduled" status indicator
- Next billing date and transition information

You can modify or cancel scheduled changes anytime before they take effect by clicking "Edit Plan."

## Credit Consumption Rates

While specific credit costs vary by operation, understanding typical patterns helps you plan:

**Lower credit usage:**
- Simple code analyses
- Single file processing
- Quick documentation lookups

**Higher credit usage:**
- Complex workflow executions
- Multiple file analyses
- Comprehensive documentation generation
- Advanced code generation tasks

## Usage Best Practices

**Plan Selection:**
- Start with the Free plan to explore features
- Monitor your usage patterns for 1-2 billing cycles
- Upgrade to a Pro tier that provides 20-30% buffer above your typical usage

**Credit Management:**
- Check your usage regularly through the Cost Analysis page
- Run smaller test workflows before large operations
- Prioritize your most important tasks when approaching your limit

**Avoiding Overages:**
- Free plan users cannot exceed their 50 credit limit - operations will be blocked
- Pro plan users should monitor the progress bar and remaining credits
- Upgrade your plan if you consistently approach your limit

## Billing Cycle

Credits operate on a monthly billing cycle:

1. **Cycle Start:** Credits are allocated based on your plan
2. **During Month:** Credits are consumed as you use OrchestrAI
3. **Cycle End:** Remaining credits expire (they don't roll over)
4. **Next Cycle:** Credits reset to your plan's monthly limit

For Free plans, the cycle resets on the first of each month. For Pro plans, the cycle aligns with your subscription start date.

## Role-Based Access (Pro Only)

Pro plans include role-based access controls, which allow you to:
- Control which team members can approve workflows for release
- Manage who can operate and call AI agents
- Set permissions per user or role

This ensures workspace members only access resources and actions they're authorized to use.
