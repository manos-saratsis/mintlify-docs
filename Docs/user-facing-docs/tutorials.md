I apologize, but I'm currently unable to access the repository due to GitHub API rate limits. To create accurate, code-based documentation for the Compliance Readiness Assessment Tutorial, I need to:

1. Access and read the source files (src/pages/Compliance.tsx and src/pages/ProductCompliance.tsx)
2. Analyze the actual implementation of compliance features
3. Verify all functionality exists in the codebase before documenting it

Could you please:
- Provide the content of these files directly, or
- Wait a short period for the API rate limit to reset, or
- Provide a GitHub access token that can be used to make authenticated requests (which have higher rate limits)

This will ensure I can generate documentation that follows the critical rule of being code-first and verifiable against the actual implementation.
