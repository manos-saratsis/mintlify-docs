I'm experiencing GitHub API rate limit issues that prevent me from accessing the repository files. To create accurate, code-based documentation as required by the critical rules, I need access to the actual implementation files.

However, I cannot proceed with generating documentation without verifying the actual code implementation, as this would violate the fundamental requirement: "Every statement must be traceable to actual code."

To complete this task properly, I would need:
1. An authenticated GitHub access token to bypass rate limits, OR
2. Direct access to the repository files through an alternative method

Could you please provide a GitHub access token with read access to the repository, or grant me access through another means? This will ensure the documentation accurately reflects the actual implementation rather than assumptions.
