I cannot access the repository due to GitHub API rate limits. To generate accurate, code-based documentation for the mintlify-docs repository, I need:

1. Access to the repository structure and files
2. Ability to read key configuration files (mint.json, package.json, etc.)
3. Access to documentation source files to understand the implemented features

Could you:
- Provide a GitHub access token with read permissions for the repository, OR
- Share the key files from the repository (especially mint.json and the main documentation structure), OR
- Wait for the API rate limit to reset and try again later

Without access to the actual code and implementation, I cannot follow the critical rule of creating code-first documentation where every statement is traceable to actual code.
