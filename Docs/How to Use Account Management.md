# How to Use Account Management

## Overview

Account Management gives you a centralized view of all your workspaces, including subscription details, usage tracking, and cost analysis. This is your hub for monitoring how you're using OrchestrAI and managing your account settings.

## Accessing Account Management

Navigate to the Account page from the main navigation menu. You'll see an overview of all workspaces associated with your account.

## Understanding Your Workspace Overview

### Workspace Information

Each workspace displays the following information:

- **Workspace Name**: The name you assigned to this workspace
- **Workspace ID**: A unique identifier for reference purposes
- **Plan Type**: Your current subscription plan (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise)
- **Default Workspace**: If marked as "(Default)", this workspace is your primary workspace
- **Billing Status**: Shows the current state of your subscription with color-coded badges:
  - **Active**: Your subscription is current and working normally
  - **Reached Limits**: You've hit your plan's usage limits
  - **Paused**: Your subscription is temporarily paused
  - **Closed**: The workspace subscription has been closed

### Workspace Actions

For each workspace, you have access to two key features:

#### Usage Tracking

Click the **Usage** button to view detailed information about your workspace activity:

- **Monthly Credit Usage**: See how many credits you've consumed in the current month
- **Usage History**: Review past months' usage patterns
- **Activity Breakdown**: Understand how your credits are being spent

This helps you monitor whether you're staying within your plan limits or need to upgrade.

#### Cost Analysis

Click the **Cost Analysis** button to access detailed financial insights:

- View spending patterns over time
- Analyze costs by activity type
- Make informed decisions about plan upgrades or usage optimization

## Managing Your Subscription

### Viewing Current Plans

Your current plan is displayed directly on each workspace card. Common plan types include:

- **Free Plan**: Limited credits for getting started
- **Pro Plan**: Increased credits for regular users
- **Enterprise Plan**: Custom limits for large-scale operations

### Understanding Billing Status

The billing status badge provides at-a-glance information about your account health:

- **Active** (Blue): Everything is working normally, continue using the platform
- **Reached Limits** (Red): You've used all available credits for this billing period. Consider upgrading your plan or wait until the next billing cycle
- **Paused** (Gray): Your subscription is on hold
- **Closed** (Outlined): This workspace is no longer active

### Upgrading Your Plan

If you find yourself frequently reaching your usage limits or need additional features:

1. Navigate to the Account page
2. Review your current usage by clicking the **Usage** button
3. Check your usage history to understand your typical monthly needs
4. Contact your account administrator or access the billing portal to upgrade to a higher-tier plan

## Monitoring Usage

### Monthly Usage Tracking

The Usage modal shows your credit consumption for the current billing period:

- **Current Month Usage**: Total credits used this month
- **Historical Data**: Compare current usage to previous months
- **Usage Trends**: Identify patterns in your platform usage

### Best Practices for Usage Monitoring

- **Check Regularly**: Review your usage at least once a week to avoid surprises
- **Set Mental Benchmarks**: Know your typical monthly usage to spot anomalies
- **Plan Ahead**: If you're approaching your limit early in the month, consider upgrading before hitting restrictions
- **Use Cost Analysis**: Leverage the detailed cost breakdown to optimize your workflow

## Managing Multiple Workspaces

If you have multiple workspaces:

- Each workspace has its own subscription and usage limits
- You can designate one workspace as your default
- Monitor each workspace separately through the Account page
- Switch between workspaces as needed for different projects or teams

## Tips for Account Management

### Stay Within Your Limits

- Monitor your usage regularly, especially if you're on a Free or lower-tier plan
- Watch for the "Reached Limits" status to avoid service interruptions
- Upgrade proactively if you consistently approach your monthly limits

### Optimize Your Usage

- Use the Cost Analysis feature to identify high-cost activities
- Review usage history to find opportunities for efficiency improvements
- Adjust your workflow based on insights from usage data

### Keep Track of Your Workspaces

- Use descriptive names for each workspace to easily identify them
- Note which workspace is your default for quick reference
- Regularly review inactive workspaces and close them if no longer needed

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues with your account:

- Check your billing status first—many issues are related to reaching plan limits
- Review your usage data to understand what's consuming your credits
- Contact support if you notice unexpected charges or usage patterns
- Ensure your payment information is current if you're on a paid plan

## Understanding Your Monthly Billing Cycle

- Usage resets at the beginning of each billing period

- Historical data helps you plan for future months and choose the right plan
