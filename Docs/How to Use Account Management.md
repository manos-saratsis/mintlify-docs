# How to Use Account Management

## Overview

The Account Management page is your central hub for monitoring and managing all your OrchestrAI workspaces. From this page, you can view workspace details, check billing status, monitor usage patterns, and analyze costs across all your workspaces.

## Accessing Account Management

Navigate to the Account page from the main navigation menu. The page will automatically load and display all workspaces associated with your account.

## Understanding Your Account Dashboard

### Workspace Cards

Each workspace appears as a card displaying key information:

**Workspace Information:**
- **Workspace Name**: The name you've assigned to your workspace
- **Workspace ID**: A unique identifier for your workspace
- **Plan Type**: Your current subscription plan (e.g., Free, Professional, Enterprise)
- **Default Status**: Indicates if this is your default workspace

**Billing Status Badge:**
Each workspace displays a color-coded status indicator:
- **Active**: Workspace is operating normally with available credits
- **Reached Limits**: You've hit your usage limits and may need to upgrade
- **Paused**: Workspace is temporarily suspended
- **Closed**: Workspace has been deactivated

## Monitoring Workspace Usage

### Viewing Usage Details

To check how much you've used your workspace:

1. Locate the workspace you want to review
2. Click the **Usage** button on the workspace card
3. A detailed usage history window will appear showing your monthly consumption

The usage modal displays:
- Current month's activity
- Historical usage patterns
- Credit consumption trends
- Execution counts for your agents

### Analyzing Costs

To understand your spending patterns:

1. Find the workspace you want to analyze
2. Click the **Cost Analysis** button
3. You'll be taken to a detailed cost breakdown page

The Cost Analysis page shows:
- Spending trends over time
- Cost breakdowns by agent or service
- Visual charts and graphs for easy understanding
- Budget tracking and forecasting

## Managing Multiple Workspaces

If you have multiple workspaces:

- All workspaces are displayed on a single page for easy comparison
- Your default workspace is clearly marked
- Each workspace maintains independent billing and usage tracking
- You can switch between workspaces seamlessly

## Understanding Workspace Plans

Your plan determines:
- Available credits per month
- Number of agent executions allowed
- Access to premium features
- Support level

Check your plan type on each workspace card to understand your current capabilities.

## When Your Workspace Reaches Limits

If your billing status shows "Reached Limits":

1. Review your usage by clicking the Usage button
2. Check the Cost Analysis to identify high-consumption areas
3. Consider upgrading your plan for additional capacity
4. Optimize your agent configurations to reduce unnecessary executions

## Best Practices

**Regular Monitoring:**
- Check your Account page weekly to track usage trends
- Review cost analysis before month-end to avoid surprises
- Set up alerts if your usage is approaching limits

**Workspace Organization:**
- Use descriptive workspace names to identify purposes easily
- Keep your default workspace for primary operations
- Create separate workspaces for testing and production

**Budget Management:**
- Monitor the usage patterns to predict monthly costs
- Use Cost Analysis to identify optimization opportunities
- Adjust agent execution frequency based on budget constraints

## Loading States

When you first access the Account page, you may see a "Loading..." message while the system retrieves your workspace information. This typically takes only a few seconds.

If you don't see any workspaces listed, you may need to create your first workspace or contact support if you believe this is an error.
