## Overview

Account Management provides a centralized dashboard where you can monitor and manage all your OrchestrAI workspaces. View workspace details, track usage, analyze costs, and monitor billing status from a single location.

## Accessing Account Management

Navigate to the Account page from the main navigation menu. The page displays an overview of all workspaces associated with your account.

## Understanding Your Account Dashboard

### Workspace Cards

Each workspace appears as a card displaying key information:

- **Workspace Name**: The display name of your workspace
- **Workspace ID**: A unique identifier for your workspace
- **Plan Type**: Your current subscription plan (e.g., Free, Pro, Enterprise)
- **Default Workspace**: If a workspace is marked as "(Default)", it's your primary workspace
- **Billing Status**: Shows the current state of your workspace billing

### Billing Status Indicators

Your workspace billing status appears as a colored badge:

- **Active**: Your workspace is in good standing with normal access
- **Reached Limits**: You've hit your plan limits and may need to upgrade
- **Paused**: Billing or workspace access is temporarily suspended
- **Closed**: The workspace is no longer active

## Monitoring Usage

### Viewing Usage Details

To see detailed usage information for any workspace:

1. Locate the workspace card you want to review
2. Click the **Usage** button on the right side of the card
3. A usage modal will open showing your consumption details

The usage modal displays:
- Monthly usage statistics
- Current month's activity
- Historical usage patterns

This helps you understand how you're consuming credits and plan resources throughout the month.

## Analyzing Costs

### Accessing Cost Analysis

For detailed cost breakdowns:

1. Find the workspace you want to analyze
2. Click the **Cost Analysis** button next to the Usage button
3. You'll be taken to a dedicated page with spending insights

The cost analysis view provides:
- Spending patterns over time
- Cost distribution across different activities
- Budget planning information

## Managing Multiple Workspaces

### Workspace Organization

If you have multiple workspaces:

- All workspaces appear in a vertical list on the Account page
- Each workspace maintains independent billing and usage tracking
- Your default workspace is clearly marked for easy identification
- Switch between workspace contexts by accessing different workspace cards

### Workspace Information

Each workspace card shows:
- The workspace name for easy identification
- The unique workspace ID for reference in support requests
- Current plan details to understand your feature access
- Real-time billing status to stay informed of any issues

## Monitoring Your Account Health

### Quick Status Checks

Use the Account page to regularly:

1. **Review Billing Status**: Check that all workspaces show "Active" status
2. **Monitor Usage**: Click Usage buttons to ensure you're within plan limits
3. **Track Costs**: Review cost analysis to stay within budget
4. **Identify Issues**: Look for "Reached Limits" or "Paused" status indicators that need attention

### Taking Action on Alerts

If you see a warning status:

- **Reached Limits**: Consider upgrading your plan or reducing usage
- **Paused**: Check your billing information and payment methods
- **Closed**: Contact support if you need to reactivate a workspace

## Best Practices
