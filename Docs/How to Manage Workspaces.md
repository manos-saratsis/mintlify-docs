# How to Manage Workspaces

Workspaces help you organize your team's work and control who has access to your code repositories and automated workflows. Each workspace can have its own team members, permissions, and configurations.

## Accessing Workspace Management

From your main Dashboard, look for the Workspace Management option in the navigation menu. You can also click the "Back to Dashboard" button from the workspace management page to return to your main view.

## Creating a New Workspace

1. On the Workspace Management page, click the **New Workspace** button in the top-right corner
2. Enter a name for your workspace in the dialog box
3. Click **Create** to finish

Your new workspace will appear in the workspaces table and you can start inviting team members right away.

## Viewing Your Workspaces

The main workspace table shows all workspaces you have access to, with the following information for each:

- **Workspace Name** - The name you gave the workspace, with a "Default" badge if it's your primary workspace
- **Creation Date** - When the workspace was created
- **Members** - How many people have access to this workspace
- **Git Connections** - Number of code repositories connected
- **Actions** - Quick buttons to switch to or manage the workspace

## Renaming a Workspace

1. Find the workspace you want to rename in the table
2. Click the small edit icon (pencil) next to the workspace name
3. Type the new name in the dialog box
4. Click **Save** to apply the change

## Switching Between Workspaces

To change which workspace you're currently working in:

1. Find the workspace in the table
2. Click the **Switch** button in the Actions column
3. The button will change to show "Current" when that workspace is active

All your work will now be associated with the selected workspace.

## Deleting a Workspace

If you no longer need a workspace:

1. Locate the workspace in the table
2. Click the trash icon in the Actions column
3. Confirm the deletion

**Note:** You cannot delete a workspace if it's your only workspace. You must have at least one workspace active.

## Managing Team Members

### Inviting People to Your Workspace

To add someone to your workspace:

1. Click the **Members** button with the plus icon next to any workspace in the table, or
2. Open the workspace details and click the **Invite** button in the Members section
3. Enter the person's email address
4. Click **Send Invitation**

The invited person will receive an email with instructions to join your workspace. They will appear in the "Pending Invitations" section until they accept.

### Viewing Workspace Members

When you select a workspace, the Members section displays:

- Each person's role (Owner, Member, etc.)
- When they joined the workspace
- A special "You" indicator for your own account

The number in parentheses next to "Members" shows the total count of people with access.

### Understanding Member Roles

Members are assigned roles that appear as badges:

- **Owner** - Has full control over the workspace, including deleting it and managing all settings
- **Member** - Can access workspace resources based on assigned permissions

### Checking Pending Invitations

The Pending Invitations section shows:

- Email addresses of people you've invited
- When each invitation was sent
- A "Pending" status badge

Invitations remain pending until the recipient creates an account and accepts the invitation.

## Managing Permissions

Click the **Permissions** button in the Members section to control what team members can do in your workspace. This takes you to a detailed permissions page where you can set access levels for different features.

## Working with Code Repositories

The Code section of workspace management shows:

- **Git Connections** - Total number of code repositories linked to this workspace
- **Enabled Repos** - How many repositories are actively being monitored (shown as enabled/total)

Click **Go to Code Management** or click anywhere on the Code card to open detailed repository settings.

## Configuring Workflows

The Workflow section displays:

- **Enabled Modules** - Badges showing which automation features are turned on
- Each module's current status (active, paused, etc.)

If no modules are enabled, you'll see "No modules enabled." Click **Go to Workflow Configuration** or click the Workflow card to set up automated workflows for your team.

## Understanding Workspace Details

When viewing a workspace, you'll see its name displayed prominently with the label "Managing workspace:" followed by the workspace name. This helps you always know which workspace you're currently managing.

## Best Practices

- **Name workspaces clearly** - Use names that describe the team or project (e.g., "Marketing Team" or "Mobile App Project")
- **Invite team members early** - Get your team set up before connecting repositories
- **Review members regularly** - Check who has access to your workspace periodically
- **Use the Default workspace** - Keep your most important or frequently used workspace as the default
- **Check pending invitations** - Follow up with team members who haven't accepted invitations

## Navigating Between Features

From Workspace Management, you can quickly access:

- **Dashboard** - Click "Back to Dashboard" at the top of the page
- **Code Management** - Click the Code card or its button
- **Workflow Configuration** - Click the Workflow card or its button
- **Permissions** - Click the Permissions button in the Members section

The workspace you're currently managing remains selected as you navigate between these features.
