## Tutorial 4: Fixing Common Code Quality Issues

Practical examples of addressing real quality problems.

### Example 1: Reducing Function Complexity

**Issue Found:**
"Function processOrder() has complexity of 25 (threshold: 10)"

**Before:**
The function does too many things:
- Validates input
- Checks inventory
- Processes payment
- Updates database
- Sends notifications
- Generates invoice
- All in one large function

**How to Fix:**
Break it into smaller, focused functions:

1. Create `validateOrderInput()`
2. Create `checkInventoryAvailability()`
3. Create `processPaymentTransaction()`
4. Create `updateOrderDatabase()`
5. Create `sendOrderNotifications()`
6. Create `generateInvoice()`

Then `processOrder()` becomes simple:
- Call each smaller function in sequence
- Handle errors from each step
- Much easier to understand and test

**After Fixing:**
New complexity: 5 (well below threshold)

### Example 2: Eliminating Code Duplication

**Issue Found:**
"Duplicate code detected across userController.js, adminController.js, and apiController.js"

**Before:**
Authentication code repeated in three places:
- Each file has its own version
- Hard to maintain (fix a bug in one place, forget the others)
- Inconsistent behavior across files

**How to Fix:**

1. Create a shared authentication utility file
2. Move the common code there
3. Have all three files use the shared function
4. Now fixing a bug fixes it everywhere

**After Fixing:**
No duplication, consistent behavior, easier maintenance

### Example 3: Adding Missing Error Handling

**Issue Found:**
"Database operations lack error handling (database.js, lines 45-67)"

**Before:**
Code assumes everything will work:
- Database connection always succeeds
- Queries never fail
- No handling for network issues

**How to Fix:**

Add proper error handling:
1. Wrap database calls in try-catch blocks
2. Handle specific error types differently
3. Log errors for debugging
4. Provide meaningful error messages to users
5. Implement retry logic for temporary failures

**After Fixing:**
Application handles problems gracefully instead of crashing
