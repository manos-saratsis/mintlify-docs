I'll analyze the source code to create a comprehensive how-to guide for generating documentation with OrchestrAI.

<thinking>
Let me examine the AIDocumentationSpecialistPanel component to understand the documentation generation workflow.

Key findings from the code:
1. The panel supports two actions: 'create' (new documentation) and 'migrate' (existing documentation)
2. Documentation scopes available: User Facing, Internal Developer, and SBOM
3. User Facing has specific content structure options: intro, tutorials, howTo, reference, concepts, troubleshooting, releaseNotes
4. Repository selection with full repo or specific commit scope
5. Custom instructions can override default workspace configuration (marked as "Priority")
6. Configuration requires: repository, folder setup in workflow settings
7. Files are generated as markdown files with customizable filenames
8. Documentation is committed to the configured repository
9. Task explanation can optionally be added at the top of files
10. Credit system applies (daily/monthly limits)
11. Progress dialog shows the generation process
12. Results can be viewed after completion

# OrchestrAI Documentation Generation Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through creating product documentation from scratch using OrchestrAI's AI Documentation Specialist. The AI analyzes your product directly and generates comprehensive documentation following industry best practices, automatically deploying it to your repository.

## Before You Start

**Prerequisites:**
- Active OrchestrAI workspace with available credits
- At least one repository connected and enabled in your workspace
- Documentation repository and folder configured in Product Information settings

**What You'll Need:**
- Access to the Documentation page in your workspace
- Permission to generate documentation (Free plan or appropriate workspace permissions)
- Clear understanding of what documentation you want to create

## Creating Documentation from Scratch

### Step 1: Access the Documentation Generator

1. Navigate to the **Documentation** page from your workspace sidebar
2. Look for the documentation action buttons in the main area
3. Click the **"Create Documentation"** button

This opens the AI Documentation Specialist panel on the right side of your screen.

### Step 2: Choose Your Documentation Scope

The panel shows several documentation types you can generate. By default, **User Facing documentation** is selected.

**Available Scopes:**

- **User Facing Documentation**: Public-facing docs for your product users
- **Internal Developer Documentation**: Technical docs for your development team  
- **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**: Component and dependency listings

You can select multiple scopes at once - the AI will generate all selected types in a single run.

### Step 3: Select User Facing Content Pieces

When User Facing documentation is selected, you'll see content structure options. These determine what documentation files are created:

**Recommended Content Pieces:**

- **Intro (Quickstart)**: Gets users started quickly - selected by default
- **Tutorials**: End-to-end, outcome-driven guides - selected by default  
- **API Reference**: Autogenerated API/SDK documentation - selected by default
- **How-To Guides**: Task-centric, short instructional content
- **Concepts**: Architecture, models, and system explanations
- **Troubleshooting**: Error catalog and debugging guides
- **Release Notes**: Automated version history

**To customize content structure:**

1. Expand the **"Customize Scope & Content Structure"** section
2. Check or uncheck the content types you want
3. At minimum, keep Intro and Tutorials selected for comprehensive documentation

### Step 4: Select Code Repositories

The AI needs access to your code to understand your product:

1. Expand the **"Select Code Scope"** section
2. All OrchestrAI-enabled repositories are listed and **selected by default**
3. Choose analysis scope for each repository:
   - **Whole Repo**: Analyzes the entire codebase (recommended for initial documentation)
   - **Specific Commit**: Documents changes from a particular commit

**For whole repository documentation:**
- Simply leave the "Whole Repo" option selected
- This gives the AI complete product understanding

**For specific commit documentation:**
1. Click **"Specific Commit"** for a repository
2. Wait for the commit list to load
3. Select the commit you want to document
4. The AI will focus on changes introduced in that commit

### Step 5: Write Custom Instructions

The **Additional Instructions** field is where you specify exactly what you want documented.

**This is the most important step** - your instructions take priority over all default settings.

**Example Custom Instructions:**

```
Focus on the authentication flow and user management features. 
Create detailed API examples for each endpoint.
Include code samples in JavaScript and Python.
Emphasize security best practices throughout.
```

**For custom documentation files:**

```
Create a dedicated guide for the payment integration process.
Include step-by-step webhook setup instructions.
Add troubleshooting section for common payment errors.
Generate API reference for all payment-related endpoints.
```

**Best practices for instructions:**
- Be specific about features to emphasize
- Mention any technical details to include
- Specify code sample languages if needed
- Note any special formatting requirements
- Reference specific sections or topics you want covered

### Step 6: Customize File Names (Optional)

Scroll down to the **Configuration** section to see files that will be generated.

For each file listed:
1. The default filename is shown (e.g., "intro", "tutorials")
2. Click the filename field to edit it
3. Enter your preferred name (without the .md extension)
4. The file will be created with your custom name

**Example customizations:**
- Change "intro" to "getting-started"
- Change "tutorials" to "guides"
- Change "reference" to "api-docs"

### Step 7: Add Task Explanations (Optional)

Check the box **"Add documentation task explanation at the top of the file"** if you want each generated file to include:
- A header explaining what the file covers
- Context about the documentation scope
- Information about when it was generated

This is helpful for maintaining documentation over time.

### Step 8: Start Documentation Generation

1. Review all your selections and instructions
2. Click the **"Generate Documentation"** button at the bottom of the panel

**What happens next:**
- A progress dialog appears showing generation steps
- The AI analyzes your selected repositories
- Documentation is generated according to your specifications
- Files are automatically committed to your configured repository

**Progress Stages:**
1. **Initializing**: Setting up the generation process
2. **Analyzing Code**: AI examines your product
3. **Generating Content**: Creating documentation files
4. **Deploying**: Committing files to your repository
5. **Complete**: Documentation is ready

### Step 9: Review Generated Documentation

Once generation completes:

1. A success message appears confirming completion
2. Click **"View Documentation"** to see the generated files
3. Your documentation is now live in your repository

The files are created in the folder you configured in Product Information settings (typically a `docs` folder in your repository).

## Deploying Your Documentation

Documentation is **automatically deployed** to your repository when generation completes. Here's what happens:

### Automatic Deployment Process

1. **Commit Creation**: The AI creates a new commit with all generated documentation files
2. **Branch**: Files are committed to your default branch (usually `main` or `master`)
3. **Location**: Files are placed in your configured documentation folder
4. **File Format**: All files are created as Markdown (.md) files

### Viewing Your Deployed Documentation

**In Your Repository:**
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Go to the documentation folder (e.g., `/docs`)
3. You'll see all generated markdown files

**Typical file structure:**
```
docs/
├── intro.md
├── tutorials.md
├── how_to.md
├── reference.md
├── concepts.md
└── troubleshooting.md
```

### Setting Up Documentation Hosting

While OrchestrAI deploys the files, you'll need to set up hosting separately:

**GitHub Pages:**
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Navigate to Pages section
3. Select your documentation branch and folder
4. Your docs will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository`

**Documentation Platforms:**
- **GitBook**: Connect your repository for automatic updates
- **ReadTheDocs**: Configure to build from your markdown files
- **Docusaurus**: Use generated files with your Docusaurus site
- **MkDocs**: Configure mkdocs.yml to use generated files

## Creating Custom Documentation Files

You can use custom instructions to generate specific documentation beyond the standard structure.

### Example: Custom Integration Guide

**Instructions:**
```
Create a comprehensive Stripe payment integration guide.
Include:
- Prerequisites and setup requirements
- Step-by-step integration process
- Code examples for creating charges
- Webhook handling instructions
- Error handling best practices
- Testing procedures
```

**Result:** The AI generates a detailed integration guide focused on your specifications.

### Example: Feature-Specific Documentation

**Instructions:**
```
Document the real-time notifications feature.
Cover:
- WebSocket connection setup
- Message format and types
- Client-side implementation
- Server-side event handling
- Reconnection logic

```

### Example: Migration Guide

**Instructions:**
```
Create a migration guide from v1 to v2 of our API.
Include:
- Breaking changes summary
- Endpoint mapping (old to new)
- Code migration examples
- Data transformation requirements
- Deprecated feature alternatives
```

## Understanding Content Structure

Each content piece serves a specific purpose in your documentation:

### Intro (Quickstart)
- First file users see
- Gets them productive quickly
- Includes installation and basic usage
- Shows "hello world" equivalent for your product

### Tutorials
- End-to-end learning experiences
- Outcome-driven (achieves a specific goal)
- Step-by-step with explanations
- Takes users from beginner to capable

### How-To Guides
- Task-focused instructions
- Shorter than tutorials
- Assumes basic knowledge
- "How do I accomplish X?" format

### API Reference
- Autogenerated from code
- Complete endpoint/method documentation
- Parameters, return values, examples
- Technical and precise

### Concepts
- Explains "why" and "how it works"
- Architecture documentation
- System design explanations
- Background knowledge

### Troubleshooting
- Common problems and solutions
- Error message catalog
- Debugging procedures
- FAQ-style content

### Release Notes
- Version history
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Breaking changes

## Tips for Best Results

### Writing Effective Instructions

**DO:**
- Be specific about features to cover
- Mention target audience (e.g., "beginners", "advanced users")
- Specify code example languages
- Reference existing documentation style if migrating
- Include any critical information that must appear

**DON'T:**
- Leave instructions blank (use them to guide the AI)
- Be vague ("make it good" won't help)
- Contradict your scope selections
- Ask for content outside selected repositories

### Choosing Repository Scope

**Use "Whole Repo" when:**
- Creating initial documentation
- You want comprehensive coverage
- Product has evolved since last documentation
- Multiple features need documenting

**Use "Specific Commit" when:**
- Updating docs for a new feature
- Documenting a specific release
- Creating release notes
- Incremental documentation updates

### Organizing Generated Files

**Standard structure recommendation:**
```
docs/
├── intro.md                 (Quickstart)
├── tutorials/              (Tutorial guides)
│   ├── getting-started.md
│   └── advanced-usage.md
├── how-to/                 (Task guides)
│   └── common-tasks.md
├── api/                    (API Reference)
│   └── reference.md
└── concepts/               (Explanations)
    └── architecture.md
```

You can request this structure in your custom instructions.

- Contact your workspace owner to grant Documentation permission

### "Credit Limit Reached"

**Problem:** No credits available for generation.

**Solution:**
- Daily limit: Wait until next day (resets at midnight UTC)
- Monthly limit: Workspace owner/admin can upgrade plan
- Click "Upgrade Plan" button if you're an admin

### Documentation Not Appearing

**Problem:** Generation completed but files not in repository.

**Solution:**
1. Check configured repository and folder in Product Information
2. Verify you have write access to the repository
3. Check repository recent commits for the documentation commit
4. Contact support if issue persists

### Incomplete Documentation

**Problem:** Generated docs missing expected content.

**Solution:**
1. Review your custom instructions for clarity
2. Ensure selected repositories contain relevant code
3. Try regenerating with more specific instructions
4. Check if all desired content structure pieces were selected

## Credit Usage

Documentation generation uses credits from your workspace allocation:

- **Free Plan**: Limited monthly credits
- **Paid Plans**: Higher monthly credits based on tier
- **Daily Limit**: Prevents accidental overuse
- **Monthly Limit**: Total credits available per billing period

Each documentation generation run consumes credits based on:
- Number of repositories analyzed
- Amount of code processed
- Number of documentation files generated
- Complexity of selected scopes

**Credit-saving tips:**
- Use specific commit scope for incremental updates
- Select only needed content structure pieces
- Avoid regenerating unchanged documentation
- Combine multiple updates into single generations when possible

## Next Steps

After generating your documentation:

1. **Review the content**: Check generated files for accuracy and completeness
2. **Customize as needed**: Edit files to add company-specific details
3. **Set up hosting**: Configure GitHub Pages or other documentation platform
4. **Share with team**: Distribute documentation URL to stakeholders
5. **Plan updates**: Schedule regular documentation updates with new releases

For ongoing documentation maintenance, use the specific commit scope to document incremental changes rather than regenerating everything.
