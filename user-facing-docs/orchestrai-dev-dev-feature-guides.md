- **Best practices**: Are you following recommended coding patterns?
- **Potential bugs**: Are there issues that could cause problems?
- **Code organization**: Is your code well-structured?

### Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific with instructions**: Instead of "analyze my code," try "check for security vulnerabilities in authentication code"
2. **Run analyses regularly**: Check your code quality after major changes
3. **Start with one repository**: Get familiar with the process before analyzing multiple projects
4. **Review issues systematically**: Work through suggestions one category at a time

### When Things Don't Work

If your analysis doesn't start:
- Make sure your repository is properly connected
- Check that Code Quality is enabled in your workspace settings
- Verify you have the necessary permissions
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting your repository

If you don't see results:
- Wait a few more minutes - large repositories take longer
- Check the progress window for error messages
- Make sure your repository contains code (not just documentation)

### Understanding Permissions

Some workspaces have restrictions on who can run analyses:
- Free plans: Everyone can run analyses
- Paid plans: Check with your workspace administrator if you see permission messages
- If you see "Permission Denied," contact your admin to grant access

## Compliance Analysis Tutorial

### Overview

The Compliance feature helps ensure your code meets regulatory and security standards. It's like having a compliance officer review your code, checking that you're following important rules about data privacy, security, and other requirements.

### Getting Started with Compliance

#### Step 1: Enable Compliance Analysis

Compliance is not enabled by default. Here's how to turn it on:

1. Go to the Product section
2. Click on "Workflow" in the navigation
3. Find the "Compliance" section
4. Change the setting from "Disabled" to "Analysis Only" or "Analysis and Fix"
5. Click "Save"

**Note**: You need administrator permissions to change workflow settings.

#### Step 2: Access Compliance

1. From the main menu, go to the Product section
2. Click on "Compliance" in the navigation
3. You'll see your list of connected repositories

#### Step 3: Select a Repository to Analyze

1. Find the repository you want to check for compliance
2. Click the "Analyze Compliance" button
3. A panel will open on the right side of your screen

The panel shows:
- Repository information
- Analysis instructions
- Current compliance settings

#### Step 4: Configure Your Analysis

Before starting, you can customize what the analysis checks:

1. In the instructions box, describe what you want to focus on
   - Example: "Focus on data privacy and encryption"
   - Example: "Check GDPR compliance requirements"
   - Example: "Verify access control implementation"

2. Review the repository information to make sure you're analyzing the right code

#### Step 5: Start the Compliance Check

1. Review or update the analysis instructions
2. Click the "Start Analysis" button
3. A progress window will appear

The compliance analysis goes through several steps:
- Connecting to your repository
- Reviewing your code structure
- Checking security practices
- Analyzing data handling
- Examining access controls
- Generating compliance report

This process typically takes several minutes.
