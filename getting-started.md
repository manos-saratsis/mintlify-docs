I'll analyze the provided source code to create user-facing Getting Started documentation. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the actual features and user flows.

<source_code_analysis>

Based on my analysis of the provided files, I can see this is a Mintlify documentation starter kit, not the OrchestRAI application referenced in some of the markdown files. The actual source code shows:

1. **README.md**: A Mintlify starter kit for documentation
2. **docs.json**: Configuration for a Mint-themed documentation site
3. **api-reference/openapi.json**: A sample Plant Store API
4. **Existing documentation files**: Contains references to OrchestRAI but these appear to be example/template content

The actual product is a **documentation platform builder** using Mintlify, not the OrchestRAI AI development platform described in the markdown files.

# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will help you start building beautiful documentation for your project. In just a few minutes, you'll have a professional documentation site up and running.

## What You'll Create

You're about to create a modern documentation website where you can share guides, tutorials, API references, and more with your users. The site will be fast, searchable, and easy to customize with your brand.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:
- A GitHub account
- Your project or API that needs documentation
- About 10 minutes to get everything set up

## Your First Steps

### 1. Get Your Documentation Template

Start by getting your own copy of the documentation template:

1. Visit the Mintlify Starter Kit repository on GitHub
2. Look for the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of the page
3. Click it to create your own copy

This gives you everything you need: example pages, navigation structure, and sample content you can customize.

### 2. Set Up Your Local Environment

To preview your documentation as you write, you'll need to install a small helper tool:

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```
npm i -g mint
```

This installs the Mintlify preview tool on your computer.

### 3. See Your Documentation Live

Now you can see your documentation in action:

1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to the folder where you saved your documentation (where you see a file called `docs.json`)
3. Run this command:
   ```
   mint dev
   ```
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

You'll see your documentation site running on your computer! Any changes you make to your files will appear instantly in your browser.

## What's Included

Your new documentation comes with helpful examples to get you started:

**Guide Pages**: Step-by-step instructions showing your users how to accomplish specific tasks

**Navigation**: A pre-built menu structure you can customize to organize your content

**Customizations**: Options to match your brand colors, logo, and style

**API Reference Pages**: Ready-to-use templates for documenting your APIs

**Popular Components**: Useful elements like code blocks, callouts, and cards that make your documentation engaging

## Making It Yours

### Customize Your Branding

Open the `docs.json` file to personalize your documentation:

- **Colors**: Change the primary, light, and dark colors to match your brand
- **Logo**: Add your own logo images (you'll see where to place them in the logo section)
- **Name**: Update the site name to reflect your project

### Organize Your Content

The navigation structure is defined in the `docs.json` file. You'll see sections for:
- Getting started guides
- Customization options
- Content writing tips
- AI tools integration
- API reference

Feel free to add, remove, or reorganize these sections to fit your needs.

### Write Your Content

All your documentation pages are written in Markdown files (files ending in `.md`). You can:
- Edit the existing example pages to match your content
- Create new pages by adding new `.md` files
- Add images, code examples, and other rich content

## Publishing Your Documentation

When you're ready to share your documentation with the world:

### Connect to Your Dashboard

1. Go to your Mintlify dashboard at `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app`
2. Install the GitHub app
3. Connect it to your documentation repository

Once connected, your documentation will automatically update every time you make changes. Just save your files and push them to GitHubâ€”your live documentation site will refresh automatically.

## Get Help When You Need It

### Something Not Working?

**Preview Not Starting**: Run `mint update` in your terminal to get the latest version of the preview tool

**Page Shows as 404**: Make sure you're running the preview from the folder that contains your `docs.json` file

### Learn More

- **Full Documentation**: Visit [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs) for detailed guides
- **Support**: Email hi@mintlify.com if you need assistance

## What's Next

Now that your documentation is running, here are some great next steps:

1. **Explore the Examples**: Look through the sample pages to see what's possible
2. **Customize Your Settings**: Update colors, logos, and navigation to match your brand
3. **Write Your First Page**: Replace the example content with information about your project
4. **Add Your API**: If you have an API, use the included OpenAPI integration to document it automatically
5. **Go Live**: When you're happy with your documentation, connect it to publish

Remember: your documentation is a living resource. You can update it anytime, and changes will appear on your live site automatically.

**Update Tool**: `mint update`  
**Preview URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
