# Feature Guides

OrchestRAI's AI-powered platform helps you improve your code quality, generate tests, ensure compliance, and create documentation. These guides show you how to use each feature to accomplish specific tasks with clear, step-by-step instructions.

## Getting Started with Code Quality Analysis

### Understanding Your Code Quality

Want to know how healthy your code is? The platform can analyze your entire codebase and give you a clear picture of what's working well and what needs attention.

**What You'll Get:**
- A quality score that shows the overall health of your code
- Specific areas that need improvement
- Clear explanations of what each issue means
- Suggestions for how to fix problems

**How to Analyze Your Code:**

1. After signing in, go to the Code section from the main menu
2. If this is your first time, you'll need to connect your GitHub account - just click the button and follow the prompts to give the platform access to your repositories
3. Once connected, you'll see a list of your repositories
4. Find the repository you want to analyze and click the "Analyze" button next to it
5. A window will open where you can choose what to focus on - you can look at everything or just focus on security issues, readability, or other specific areas
6. Click "Start Analysis" and wait while the AI examines your code
7. You'll see a progress indicator showing what's happening - this usually takes a few minutes depending on how large your codebase is

**Understanding Your Results:**

After the analysis finishes, you'll see scores for different aspects of your code:

- **Readability**: How easy your code is to understand
- **Maintainability**: How easy it will be to update and modify your code
- **Reliability**: How dependable your code is
- **Security**: Whether there are potential security vulnerabilities
- **Efficiency**: How well your code performs
- **Testability**: How easy it is to write tests for your code

Each score is on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher numbers being better.

**Viewing Detailed Issues:**

Click "View Details" to see exactly what problems were found. For each issue, you'll see:

- Where in your code the problem exists
- What the problem is in plain language
- Why it matters
- How to fix it

You can filter issues by severity to focus on the most critical problems first, or look at specific files to tackle improvements one piece at a time.

**Taking Action:**

The platform highlights critical issues that need immediate attention. Start with these, then work your way through other suggestions based on your priorities. Each recommendation includes specific guidance on how to make the improvement.

## Generating Tests Automatically

### Creating Tests for Your Code

Writing tests can be time-consuming, but they're essential for ensuring your code works correctly. The platform can automatically generate comprehensive tests for you.

**What You'll Get:**
- Test code that's ready to use
- Coverage for different scenarios and edge cases
- Tests that follow your project's existing testing patterns
- Estimates of how much of your code will be covered by the new tests

**How to Generate Tests:**

1. Go to the Code section and find the repository you want to create tests for
2. Click the "Generate Tests" button for that repository
3. A window will open where you can configure what kind of tests you want
4. Choose which parts of your code to test - you can test everything, just recently changed files, or specific parts
5. Select the types of tests you need:
   - **Unit tests** check individual functions and features
   - **Integration tests** verify that different parts work together correctly
   - **End-to-end tests** simulate real user interactions with your application
6. If you want to give the AI specific instructions about what to focus on, add them in the additional instructions box
7. Click "Generate Tests" and the AI will begin creating your test suite

**Monitoring Test Generation:**

While tests are being generated, you'll see progress through several stages:

- Analyzing your code structure and patterns
- Planning the test strategy
- Writing the actual test code
- Checking that the generated tests are valid

This typically takes several minutes for a full test suite.

**Reviewing Generated Tests:**

Once generation is complete, you'll see:

- How many test files were created
- The total number of test cases
- An estimate of code coverage improvement
- A list of all the files that were generated

You can review each test file to see exactly what was created. The tests include:

- Clear descriptions of what each test checks
- Setup code needed to run the tests
- Expected results for different scenarios
- Any mock data or fake services needed for testing

**Using Your New Tests:**

The generated tests are designed to work with your existing testing framework. You can:

1. Copy the test code into your project
2. Run the tests to verify they work correctly
3. Adjust any tests that need customization for your specific needs
4. Add the tests to your continuous integration pipeline so they run automatically

The platform provides instructions for integrating the tests based on what testing tools your project already uses.

## Checking Compliance and Security

### Ensuring Your Code Meets Standards

If your application needs to meet specific regulatory requirements or security standards, the platform can check your code for compliance issues.

**What You'll Get:**
- Identification of areas that don't meet compliance requirements
- Explanations of what regulations require
- Risk assessments for potential violations
- Guidance on how to fix compliance issues

**How to Check Compliance:**

1. Navigate to the Code section and select your repository
2. Click the option for compliance checking
3. A configuration window will open where you can specify which standards apply to your project
4. Choose from common frameworks like:
   - **GDPR** for European data privacy
   - **HIPAA** for healthcare data
   - **PCI DSS** for payment card data
   - **SOC 2** for service organizations
   - **ISO 27001** for information security
5. You can check against multiple standards at once if needed
6. Optionally, add specific instructions about requirements unique to your organization
7. Click "Start Analysis" to begin the compliance check

**Understanding Compliance Results:**

The analysis will identify:

- **Critical issues** that pose immediate compliance risks
- **Warnings** about potential problems that should be addressed
- **Recommendations** for improving overall compliance posture
- Specific code locations where issues were found

Each finding explains:

- What the compliance requirement is
- How your code currently fails to meet it
- What could happen if the issue isn't fixed
- Concrete steps to resolve the problem

**Taking Action on Findings:**

Focus first on critical issues, as these represent the highest risk. The platform prioritizes findings based on:

- Severity of the potential violation
- Likelihood of causing actual compliance problems
- Business impact if the issue were exploited

For each issue, you can:

- View the specific code that needs attention
- See the recommended fix
- Track when the issue was identified
- Mark issues as resolved once fixed

**Continuous Compliance Monitoring:**

You can set up the platform to automatically check for compliance issues whenever code changes are made, helping you catch potential problems before they become serious violations.

## Creating Documentation

## Getting Help

### Troubleshooting Common Situations

**If Your Repository Won't Connect:**

- Make sure you've granted the platform permission to access the repository in GitHub
- Check that you have appropriate permissions in the repository itself
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting your GitHub account
- If the repository is very large, it might take extra time to initially connect

**If Analysis Keeps Failing:**

- Very large repositories might need to be analyzed in smaller pieces
- Check if your repository has unusual structure or organization
- Ensure the repository contains code in a supported programming language
- Try analyzing a smaller subset first to identify the issue

**If Results Don't Appear:**

- Refresh the page to ensure you're seeing the latest data
- Check that the analysis actually completed successfully
- Verify you have permission to view results for that repository
- Look for any error messages that might explain the issue

**If Generated Tests or Documentation Aren't Quite Right:**

- The AI does its best based on your code, but sometimes needs more context
- Try regenerating with more specific instructions about what you need
- You can always edit generated content to better match your needs
- Some highly specialized areas might need human expertise to supplement AI generation
